### To test or run

* To test or run, clone this repo to get the project files locally and either:
1. To run the the unit tests, type `./gradlew test` in the project root (I'm on a unix like system)
2. To run the tiny sample application, type `./gradlew run`

Or one could import import into IDE (say intellij) to run the main class demo. 

### Relevant files
Relevant files are in `src/main/java` and `src/test/java` (and the gradle build files is at the project root).
